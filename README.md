# It Came from the Dessert

Entry for [Ludum Dare 37](http://ldjam.com/) and the topic "One Room".

The cake fills your kitchen with giant ants. 
Bate them with pizza slices into kitchen objects to kill them.

Look around the kitchen with your mouse. Move around with WASD.
Throw pizza slices at the object you are looking at with the left mouse button. Up to 6 pizza slices at once.
Retrieve the pizza slices by clicking on them again with the left mouse button.
Use the right mouse button to open kitchen objects to activate the murder utensils.
